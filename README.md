# ðŸš€ Space Fuel Clicker Game

A space-themed incremental clicker game where you launch rockets to generate fuel and purchase upgrades to build your space empire. Built with TypeScript.

## UI Design Credits

This project's user interface was improved with inspiration from peer projects in the [CMPM 121 D1 Gallery](https://rndmcnlly.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-d1-gallery/):

### Dark Space Background Theme

Inspired by various space-themed projects in the gallery that featured dark backgrounds with atmospheric effects. The dark space gradient background with subtle starfield pattern creates an immersive space exploration atmosphere that fits the rocket launching theme.

### Interactive Button Animations

Inspired by peer projects featuring smooth hover effects and visual feedback. The launch button and upgrade buttons now feature:

- Hover effects with scale and shadow transitions
- Active state feedback for click interactions
- Smooth CSS transitions for better user experience
- Visual glow effects that match the space theme
